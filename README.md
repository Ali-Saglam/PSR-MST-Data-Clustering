# PSR-MST Data Clustering
A python adaptation from the method described in the paper [Sequential image segmentation based on minimum spanning tree representation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167865516301192).

### Dependence:
The code depends on the following third-party libraries:
- fibheap 0.2.1

```
pip install fibheap
```

### Run demo: 
```
python Demo_clustering.py
```

### Parameters:
*m* : The coefficient of the parameters c that calculated automatically using the differential of the PSR-MST in the [source paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167865516301192). If no value is given, the default value is ``3``.

*l* : The length of the scanning frame (sub-string) that scans through the PSR-MST. If no value is given, the default value is ``"scale"`` that computed by ``int( sqrt(datasize) / 2``).

### Segmentation  fuction:

 ``labels = sequential_clustering(data)`` -----> *m* = 3, *l* = "scale"

``labels = sequential_clustering(data, m = 4)`` -----> *l* = "scale"

``labels = sequential_clustering(data, m = 4, l = 10)``
